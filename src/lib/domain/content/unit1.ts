      'Compassionate non-violence, open-mindedness, and contentment in daily choices',
    warmupWrong: 'Rituals alone, without lifestyle change',
    coreIdea:
      'Jainism can be lived as a practical operating system for modern life, centered on Triple A: Ahimsa (non-violence), Anekantvad (many-sided understanding), and Aparigraha (non-possessiveness). These are not abstract ideals; they are daily disciplines for reducing harm, ego, and excess while building clarity and inner stability.',
    whyItMatters:
      'When the AAA framework is practiced consistently, it improves relationships, lowers inner conflict, and creates a values-based way to navigate technology, social pressure, politics, and consumer culture. It turns spirituality into a repeatable life method.',
    practiceTip:
      'Before major choices, run a three-point check: Does this reduce harm? Does this respect other viewpoints? Does this reduce unnecessary attachment?',

      'Jainism is presented as a living discipline where personal awakening and social ethics are inseparable. The mission is coexistence: to live consciously, reduce avoidable harm, and support the wellbeing of all life forms, not just human convenience.',

      'Jain identity can span a broad spectrum: deeply traditional practitioners, modern seekers, value-centered AAA practitioners, and newcomers. The unifying core is ethical alignment, especially Ahimsa, Anekantvad, and Aparigraha.',
    whyItMatters:
      'A spectrum model reduces judgment and encourages participation across generations, geographies, and backgrounds. It helps communities stay both principled and welcoming.',

      'Without this expanded definition, people may avoid obvious violence but still cause damage through speech, consumption, and indifference. Full Ahimsa builds trustworthy character and social healing.',
